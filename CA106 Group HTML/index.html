                <h2 class="subtitle">An ever growing industry</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The modern video game industry is massive, itâ€™s expected to bring in over $200 Billion in revenue by 2023. The Industry has always been a constant source of success but in recent decades it has grown exponentially. And in these current times, demand has soared as people search for games and gadgets to occupy their time at home.</p>
                <p>The game industry has seen growth in all of its sectors, companies are branching out and investing in projects that never would have existed a few years ago, esports and mobile games to name just two.</p>
                <p>But as the game industry continues to grow, companies now battle it out to be the most successful and bring in the most profit, video games are no longer the coveted child of a single developer, they are made and engineered to be successful and make a profit for big corporations. The old nostalgia factor that games from a decade ago garner is no longer wanted by companies.</p>
                <p>In this increasingly profit-driven climate, games either win big or fail hard. Companies can invest all their time and effort to try and win big in the big Triple-A games of the year, or turn to safer but controversial methods of making profit in their games.
